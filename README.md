# BUILD GPT
This is a follow along to Andrej Karpathy's [awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=6533s)on building a tiny version of OpenAI's Chat-GPT!

# Prerequisites
- You have python3 installed on your machine.
- This repo uses the standard `urllib` library to fetch the training dataset. To successfully make
  GET requests, I first needed to run the `Install Certificates.command` script which on my Macbook
  was located in my `Applications/Python 3.11` folder.
